## Introduction:

I created a responsive website called “Candy” where you can see various products (Chocolates and different types of candies). You can place an order by using add to cart functionality. While switching pages, you can see a loader. This website allows you all the basal services that website provides.

## Scope

This is a user-friendly site that can help to attract more customers by using the images of products and providing them with an easy way of ordering things. By this, they can keep a record of them. Moreover, it will be faultless and efficient in case of totaling bills. This is the best way of keeping customers updated about the new arrivals.

## Module Description:

This project consists of various pages and subpages that are:
-	Home
-	Order
-	Menu

The Menu page provides the cart functionality. It uses JavaScript event listeners, query selectors and local storage to provide cart service. Each product contain multiple products with add to cart button. By clicking this button, the record is added to your cart that you can see on the cart. By Clicking on checkout button you will redirect to checkout page, where you provide all your personal information for delievery.

## Tools Used:
